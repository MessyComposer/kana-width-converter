# Japanese Width Converter

This is an Android application developed using Kotlin. The main purpose of this project was to try out Kotlin while solving a problem that I've encountered often while filling out Japanese forms, where I fill in information in half-width kana but they require full-width and vice-versa.

## Features

- Context menu to convert the selected text directly
- Paste from and copy to clipboard
- Swap between half/full width

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and open the project in Android Studio.
2. Connect your Android device or start an emulator.
3. Click on the "Run" button in Android Studio.

## Unit Testing

This project includes unit tests to ensure the functionality of the application. To run the tests:

1. Open the project in Android Studio.
2. Right-click the test directory and select "Run".
